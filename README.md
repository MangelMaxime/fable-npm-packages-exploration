# Fable NPM Packages exploration

This repository is used to explore if it could be possible to make some of the
project redirect to `NPM packages`. In this local test, we don't use real NPM
packages, but we use a local folder to simulate the NPM packages.

## Usage

Run `./build.sh`, it should compile the library and the client project separately.

Then the client output will be adapted to use the library output instead of the
code generated by Fable for the inlining the library in the client folder.

You should then see:

```text
Hello John Doe
Hello John Doe
```
